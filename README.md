SUMMARY
=======

This is an extremely simple and naive photo uploader for Flickr.

WARNING: This repository is now deprecated. Flickr has updated their authentication mechanism to required OAuth and this script only uses the older precursor to OAuth. I'm not going to update the script as there are doubtlessly better alternatives out there, and shell is actually a terrible way of doing this. However if you really feel like modifying it, it has been relicensed under MIT and you are free to do with it as you wish.

REQUIREMENTS
============
 * curl
 * awk
 * grep
 * tr
 * md5sum (or md5)

USAGE
=====
flickr-shell-uploader [-t TITLE] [-d DESCRIPTION] [-a TAGS] [-p IS_PUBLIC] [-f IS_FRIEND] [-m IS_FAMILY] [-s SAFETY_LEVEL] [-c CONTENT_TYPE] [-h HIDDEN] -i <file> [-i <file> ...]

    All of the below options are optional (aside from files to upload):
    TITLE: Title of your photo.
    DESCRIPTION: Description of your photo.
    TAGS: Comma-separated list of tags for the photo (no spaces).
    IS_PUBLIC: 0 = no, 1 = yes - viewable by anyone.
    IS_FRIEND: 0 = no, 1 = yes - friends can view the photo.
    IS_FAMILY: 0 = no, 1 = yes - family can view the photo.
    SAFETY_LEVEL: 1 = safe, 2 = moderate, 3 = restricted.
    CONTENT_TYPE: 1 = photo, 2 = screenshot, 3 = other.
    HIDDEN: 1 = visible, 2 = hidden. Hides the photo from public searches.

    One or more files may be supplied, but the above options may only be useful for individual files!

It will create a "frob" which will need to be authenticated against your
account. When it asks you to, please visit the URL it prints out which will
take you to a page on Flickr where you can authenticate the request.

Once authenticated, a token is granted to this script that will be used from
then on to upload to your account. The frob and token are stored in
~/.flickr-shell-uploader. If you have removed access for this application
you should delete this file and start the authentication process again.

NOTES
=====
Proxies should be handled by curl natively.
